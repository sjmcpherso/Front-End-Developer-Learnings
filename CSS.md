<h2>CSS Coding & Performance Tips</h2>

 - Limit Browser rendering with CSS Box-shadows, Gradients
 - Minify CSS (Removes whitespace/linebreaks reducing file size)
 - Combine CSS (Reduce the amount of HTTP Requests)
 - :after{content:"more";} & :before{} IE8+ Allows you to add content before/after an element
 - *{} targets every element (Not recommend adds performance issues)
 - ul > li{} IE7+ targets direct children
 - ul ~ p{} IE7+ targets p tags after ul tag
 - Avoid using IDs in CSS
 - h1 + p{} IE7+ targets adjacent p tags directly after h1 tags
 - a[data-info~="image"]{} IE7+ selects all elements that have a data-info of “image” including multiple values such as  data-info="external image"
 - :first-child{} IE7+ targets the first child element
 - :last-child{} IE9+ targets the last child element
 - li:nth-child(3) IE9+
 - Work around for lack of :nth-child support in IE7 & IE8 using adjacent selector: ul>li+li+li
 - background-image: image-set(url("test.png") 1x, url("test-2x.png") 2x); Safari 6+ and Chrome 21+ ONLY
 - background-clip, background-origin and background-size IE9+
 - HasLayout - The single most important thing you need to know about fixing bugs in <IE8, Giving an element "Layout" will fix 99% of IE rendering bugs, as if by magic. The other 1% will most likely be related to position: relative; or floats. Use "zoom: 1" as a trigger for whatever IE versions need it. Eg .ie6 #myElement, .ie7 #myElement { zoom: 1 }
 - X:first-letter/:first-line apply to block level elements compatible with all browser versions
 - Avoid unnecessary tag identifiers for performance i.e. ul#navigation,ul.menu{} replace #navigation,.menu{}
 - Avoid using ancestors html div tr td{} Most modern browsers work from the right & work them way up
 - Chaining can mean loss of performance so when you do chain use the least used first i.e. use #foo.bar instead of .bar#foo
 - Multi-column Wrapping Text layouts with -column-count: 3; IE10+
 - -flex: The new Flexible Box layout Module for fluid layouts - http://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/css/flexbox/index.html IE10+ includes -order: for ordering structure elements -justify-content: for aligning structure elements and -webkit-flex-direction: for positioning
 - -calc: Dynamic css calculations div {width: +calc(100% - 4em);}
 - Versions of Chrome & Safari change the anti-alias of text during CSS animations fix with body{-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;} or on the problematic area (causes WebKit to use hardware acceleration for the animations)
 - If you're floating an inline element, it's treated as block, so no need to include "display:block" in your stylesheet.
